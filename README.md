# Amphibian identification via belly patterns

This repository contains python code, statistics obtained during training and report of identification of newts and toads via their belly patterns using depp neural networks.

Python code uses Pytorch and [SimpNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06205) architecture.

Statistics are done using R, see `statistics/` directory.

We have used own dataset (~450MB), maybe I will post it somewhere. 

Pre-trained models are accessible [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17bepDCJz-dleXh1N0U6soZfJ9s7V4Ayq?usp=sharing).

Report can be seen [here](./report/report.pdf).
